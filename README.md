## Project Description

This project implements a complete pipeline for dataset generation, classifier training, and testing within an object-oriented programming Python framework.  
It supports:

- Generating datasets with customizable parameters  
- Training multiple classifier models on the generated data  
- Testing and evaluating the trained classifiers  

All functionalities are accessed through a single entry point script `main.py` using command-line arguments to specify the mode of operation.
